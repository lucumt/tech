AI Concepts Developers Should Learn

1. `Machine Learning`: Core algorithms, statistics, and model training techniques.
2. `Deep Learning`: Neural networks with multiple layers that learn complex patterns automatically.
3. `Neural Networks`: Layered structures that model complex, nonlinear relationships in data.
4. `NLP`: Techniques for processing and understanding human language in text form.
5. `Computer Vision`: Algorithms that interpret and analyze images and visual data.
6. `Reinforcement Learning`: Training agents through rewards and penalties in interactive environments.
7. `Generative Models`: AI systems that create new data based on learned patterns.
8. `LLM`: Large language models that generate human-like text from training data.
9. `Transformers`: Self-attention architecture that powers most modern AI language models.
10. `Feature Engineering`: Selecting and designing input features to improve model performance.
11. `Unsupervised Learning`: Finding patterns in data without using labeled examples.
12. `Bayesian Learning`: Using probabilistic methods to incorporate uncertainty into models.
13. `Prompt Engineering`: Crafting effective inputs to guide AI model outputs optimally.
14. `AI Agents`: Autonomous systems that observe environments and take intelligent actions.
15. `Fine-Tuning Models`: Adapting pre-trained models for specific tasks and domains.
16. `Multimodal Models`: AI systems that process text, images, audio, and video together.
17. `Embeddings`: Converting data into numerical vectors that machines can process effectively.
18. `Vector Search`: Finding similar items by comparing their mathematical vector representations.
19. `Model Evaluation`: Testing and measuring how well AI models perform on tasks.
20. `AI Infrastructure`: Building scalable systems to deploy and run AI applications.
