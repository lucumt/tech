12 Algorithms for System Design Interviews

1. `Bloom Filter`: Check if a requested item is in the cache before performing disk operations.
2.  `Geohash`: Used to build location-based services.
3. `HyperLogLog`: Counting unique queries performed by users in a search.
4. `Consistent Hashing`: Used for efficient data distribution between the cluster’s nodes.
5. `Merkle Tree`: Used to detect inconsistencies between data replicas across multiple nodes.
6. `Raft Algorithm`: Used to achieve consensus on log replication.
7. `Lossy Count`: Network traffic analysis, web analytics, and identifying heavy hitters.
8. `QuadTree`: Used to build location-based services.
9. `Operational Transformation`: Used to support collaborative editing systems.
10. `Leaky Bucket`: Used for rate limiting
11. `Rsync`: Synchronizing files and directories between two different systems.
12. `Ray Casting`: Used for geospatial analysis, collision detection in video games, and computer graphics.
