      <description>HTTPS Under the Hood&#xA;HTTPS is a secure way to share information on the internet. It encrypts data transfer between client and server.&#xA;But without common encryption key, how data is encrypted?&#xA;1 - Server Certificate Check - Client and server exchange &amp;ldquo;HELLO&amp;rdquo; messages - Server sends its certificate - Client verifies it with a Certificate Authority&#xA;2 - Key Exchange - Client extracts server&amp;rsquo;s public key, creates a session key - They agree on a cipher suite - Client encrypts session key using server&amp;rsquo;s public key - Server decrypts it</description>

      <description>How does HTTPS work? . . Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is an extension of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP.) HTTPS transmits encrypted data using Transport Layer Security (TLS.) If the data is hijacked online, all the hijacker gets is binary code.&#xA;How is the data encrypted and decrypted?&#xA;Step 1 - The client (browser) and the server establish a TCP connection.&#xA;Step 2 - The client sends a “client hello” to the server.</description>

      <description>SSH Under the Hood&#xA;Secure Shell (SSH) creates an encrypted channel between client and server. The process begins with a TCP connection, followed by version negotiation. Both parties then agree on encryption algorithms, key exchange methods, and message authentication codes. The client and server perform a key exchange (typically using Diffie-Hellman) to securely generate a shared session key for encrypting the connection. For authentication, SSH commonly uses public key authentication.</description>
